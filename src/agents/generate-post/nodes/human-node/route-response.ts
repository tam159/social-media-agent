const ROUTE_RESPONSE_PROMPT = `You are an AI assistant tasked with routing a user's response to one of two possible routes based on their intention. The two possible routes are:

1. Rewrite post - The user's response indicates they want to rewrite the generated post.
2. Update scheduled date - The user wants to update the scheduled date for the post. This can either be a new date or a priority level (P1, P2, P3).

Here is the generated post:
<post>
{POST}
</post>

Here is the current date/priority level for scheduling the post:
<date-or-priority>
{DATE_OR_PRIORITY}
</date-or-priority>

Carefully analyze the user's response:
<user-response>
{USER_RESPONSE}
</user-response>

Based on the user's response, determine which of the two routes they intend to take. Consider the following:

1. If the user mentions editing, changing, or rewriting the content of the post, choose the "rewrite_post" route.
2. If the user mentions changing the date, time, or priority level of the post, choose the "update_date" route. Ensure you only call this if the user mentions a date, or one of P1, P2 or P3.

If the user's response can not be handled by one of the two routes, choose the "unknown_response" route.

Provide your answer in the following format:
<explanation>
[A brief explanation of why you chose this route based on the user's response]
</explanation>
(call the 'route' tool to choose the route)

Here are some examples of possible user responses and the corresponding routes:

Example 1:
User: "Can we change the wording in the second paragraph?"
Route: rewrite_post
Explanation: The user is requesting changes to the content of the post.

Example 2:
User: "Schedule this for next Tuesday."
Route: update_date
Explanation: The user wants to change the posting date.

Example 3:
User: "This should be a P1 priority."
Route: update_date
Explanation: The user wants to change the priority level of the post.

Example 4:
User: "This should be a P0 priority."
Route: unknown_response
Explanation: P0 is not a valid priority level.

Example 5:
User: "Hi! How are you?"
Route: unknown_response
Explanation: The user is engaging in general conversation, not a request to change the post.

Remember to always base your decision on the actual content of the user's response, not on these examples.`;
